## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to civil war onset.

I am basing my data off of a Kalyvas and Balcells (2010) data set showing the number of wars per civil war onset type in since 1944. The link to the data is below. I intend to see the relationship between civil war onset and externalities such as the cold war and the increase of technology to see how it relates to the number of civil wars AND the types of civil war onset. I would do this by comparing the number of civil wars OR the types of civil war onset to the year it took place. Then would further my analysis by looking to see what confounding variables possibly influence the civil wars. In my sophomore tutorial, I had actually expanded the data because Kalyvas and Balcells (2010) only went up to 2004, so I was planning to include the data I had collected, and expand on it further, to try to qualify and quantify some relationships within the data set.

Here is the link to the Kalyvas and Balcells journal with the data. https://www-jstor-org.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu/stable/40863761?typeAccessWorkflow=login
